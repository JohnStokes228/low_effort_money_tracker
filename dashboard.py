"""
Build / open interactive dashboard for portfolios of choice, to include:
    - portfolio asset allocations as pie charts
    - portfolio growth over time as a line chart / asset growth over time
    - biggest gainers / loosers
    - suggested rebalances?

so we need to:
    - read in the data as a single df
    - build entire dash bloody board

best approach i recon is probs to start by creating a pair of dummy portfolios with some assets in them that we know
exist and see if we can get a demo dahsboard up and running, then we can worry about niche edge cases and failure
points later
