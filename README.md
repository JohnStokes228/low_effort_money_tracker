# low_effort_money_tracker

Project to allow user to track their current worth across multiple accounts / assets / asset classes, as I've been getting frustrated trying to keep tabs on all the separate accounts for things I have floating around.

The project will be an excuse to get some more experience with OOP for me as I haven't really used that much until now (outside of spiders). I may also use it as an excuse to work with Django / ktinker or something though thats a bit more 'software dev-y' than I'd usually care to go with these projects so not too sure if I'll commit to that yet.

Most likely, the code will utilise an / several API's to access the current value of each asset the user lists in their portfolios, along with prehaps some kind of means of tracking just bank accounts? It may also be nice to include some kind of historic valuation metrics but they're more of a V2 thing in my mind since this was just meant to be a quick thingy.

currently, 'low_effort' refers to the amount of effort put into the code. Its possible it may eventually instead refer to the amount of effort needed to use the system prehaps? lol who knows.
