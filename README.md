# low_effort_money_tracker

Project to allow user to track their current worth across multiple accounts / assets / asset classes, as I've been getting frustrated trying to keep tabs on all the separate accounts for things I have floating around.

The project will be an excuse to get some more experience with OOP for me as I haven't really used that much until now (outside of spiders). Ultimately, the code works but after taking a long lay off from it as work got hectic I've popped it on indefinite hiatus
to get back to more modeling / directly data related code bases, as I feel those would better benefit my skill development
longer term. 

MYSQL i requried to run the code BTW :O
